## Election Audit overview

A few election employees from had given us multiple tasks to complete in order to finish off an election audit of their recent congressional elections. We used a python script to complete the audit. The few tasks completed through this audit were:

1. Calculating the number of votes casted
2. List of candidates who people voted for
3. Total number of votes each county received
4. Calculating the amount of votes each candidate recieved and percentage of votes each candidate won

1. The amount of total votes cast in the election were 369,711.

  ### Election-Audit Summary
  
  The script used in this audit is very efficient and can be used in many ways one of them being that it is very useful for researchers and journalists to understand what type of candidate each state prefers. Another way this script can be reused is that it can be used in any election in general if the dataset has a number for the ballot ID and a name for the county and candidate.
